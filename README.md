This small project was created out of curiosity, and is still being developed, BUT I COULD NOT WITHHOLD MY ENTHUSIASM!
Funny, and interesting, Pacman is the mark of distinction that each Nerd carries inside.
And being able to share this passion, it is the best thing about being a programmer.
I hope you enjoy it and have a good will, as it did with me.
